# Customer-Analysis
This is my project on customer purchase behaviour analysis. Here, I analyze data from a superstore dataset to derive insights. These insights are used to give action recommendations to the company based on customer behaviour in order to increase sales and offer acceptance rates. The project consists of a google colab notebook.
